# bhAIya - The Multi Modal Search Engine

## How We Built It

**bhAIya** is written in Python and powered by the mistral:latest, along with assistance from the Llava-phi Vision model. bhAIya takes the shopkeeper's database as input and adapts to the products listed in the shop. It creates a specialized database for each store using insights from the large language model and uses it to fulfill users' queries. It uses **Few Shot learning** to identify categories from the user's prompt and match it with the already generated categories in the database. These categories on both sides are converted into vector embeddings using Word2Vec and are matched together using Cosine similarity. The top n results are returned back.
